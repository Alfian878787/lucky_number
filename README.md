The number of Life Path is considered to be the most important key number. It describes the potential events in your life, the path by which you will have to go through in life and the things that will form this way. This number in general will tell you about the lessons that you will learn, the problems you will encounter, and the opportunities that you will receive. Of course, you are right not to listen to the instructions of this number, but in numerology they believe that you will have a more bright future if you follow the number of your Life Path.
